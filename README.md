# infinum
This is a Python number library for ℚ[ω]. I'm making this library mostly for fun and to get more used to Github. ℚ[ω] is a field of numbers that extends ℚ, the rationals, with a number ω that is larger than any rational number. Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are total on ℚ[ω] (except for dividing by 0). Numbers in ℚ[ω] are of the form ∑_{i ∈ ℤ} ω^i * q_i for rationals q_i of which finitely many are non-zero.

The name is a typo. It's supposed to be called "infininum", not "infinum".
